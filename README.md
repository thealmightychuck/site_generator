Built a static site generator in python that takes a markdown file and converts it to HTML to display a webpage
See: https://thealmightychuck.github.io/site_generator/

How the SSG works:
Delete everything in the /public directory.
Copy any static assets (HTML template, images, CSS, etc.) to the /public directory.
Generate an HTML file for each Markdown file in the /content directory. For each Markdown file:

    Open the file and read its contents.
    Split the markdown into "blocks" (e.g. paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.).
    Convert each block into a tree of HTMLNode objects. For inline elements (like bold text, links, etc.) we will convert:
    Raw markdown -> TextNode -> HTMLNode
    Join all the HTMLNode blocks under one large parent HTMLNode for the pages.
    Use a recursive to_html() method to convert the HTMLNode and all its nested nodes to a giant HTML string and inject it in the HTML template.
    Write the full HTML string to a file for that page in the /public directory.
